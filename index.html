        <H2 style="text-align:right;"><u>This is my first approach to push repositories in Github</u></H2>
    <P>My first experience with pushing repositories in GitHub was both exciting and nerve-wracking. <br> After committing my code changes locally, <br> I eagerly executed the "git push" command, hoping to see my work appear on the remote repository. <br> As the progress bar moved, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and anticipation. <br> Finally, the push completed successfully, and I refreshed the repository page to witness my code now proudly displayed. <br> It was a gratifying moment, knowing that my contributions were <br> now part of a collaborative project accessible to others.</P>

    <h2 style="text-align:right;"><u>How I push my repositories</u></h2>
    <p>
        To push your repositories using the command prompt, navigate to the local repository's directory,<br> stage your changes with "git add," <br>commit them with "git commit -m," and finally, execute "git push" to upload your changes to the remote repository.
