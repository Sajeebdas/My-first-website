        <H2 style="text-align: center;"><u>This is my first approach to push repositories in Github</u></H2>
    <P>My first experience with pushing repositories in GitHub was both exciting and nerve-wracking. After committing my code changes locally, I eagerly executed the "git push" command, hoping to see my work appear on the remote repository. As the progress bar moved, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and anticipation. Finally, the push completed successfully, and I refreshed the repository page to witness my code now proudly displayed. It was a gratifying moment, knowing that my contributions were now part of a collaborative project accessible to others.</P>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>How I push my repositories</u></h2>
    <p>
        To push your repositories using the command prompt, navigate to the local repository's directory, stage your changes with "git add," commit them with "git commit -m," and finally, execute "git push" to upload your changes to the remote repository.
